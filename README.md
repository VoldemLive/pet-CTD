# Arthive

Arthive is a pre-work project for Code The Dream, aimed at creating a user-friendly catalog for viewing artworks without the distractions of other museum services.

## Project Highlights

Arthive brings several interesting features to the table:

- **Animated Hero Banner:** A captivating entrance to the art world right from the start.
- **Milestone Artworks Block:** Features artworks celebrating 100/200/300 years anniversaries, automatically selected from the API.
- **Random Artworks Block:** A collection of random artworks presented in a convenient horizontal scrolling interface.
- **Artist Catalog:** A unique and user-friendly artist selection catalog, further refined by the first letter of the artist's name. This feature is particularly beneficial as the API has pagination limits, making it challenging to fetch data from the last pages.
- **Search Functionality:** Implemented search by artist and artwork, allowing users to easily find what they're looking for.
- **DeepZoom Technology:** Offers the ability to view artworks in incredible detail, providing a unique opportunity to see every aspect of the masterpiece.
